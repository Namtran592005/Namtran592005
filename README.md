## ✦ Collaboration with AI  
Every repository here is born from a **co-creative partnership**:  

- **My role** → Vision • Concept • Structure • Testing  
- **AI’s role** → Implementation • Coding • Technical Craftsmanship  

This synergy allows me to focus on **creativity, direction, and refinement**, while AI becomes the **artisan of execution**.
